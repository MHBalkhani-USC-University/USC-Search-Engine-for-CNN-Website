The Company and its businesses provide multiple means of reporting concerns, including a HelpLine monitored 24-7, which enable anonymous reporting where permitted by local law. Third parties can also report concerns, including through the HelpLine (where permitted by local law). These various means of reporting are listed in the SBC and publicized to employees and business partners.
